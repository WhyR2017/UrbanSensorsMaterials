Description: Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions
    and S3 methods.  Major effort has been made in making definition of
    methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintenance for
    package developers.  For example, generic functions are created
    automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically
    solved, if possible.  The method setMethodS3() is a good start for
    those who in the future may want to migrate to S4.  This is a
    cross-platform package implemented in pure R that generates
    standard S3 methods.
