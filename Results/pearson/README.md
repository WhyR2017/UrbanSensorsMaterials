===================================================================

Pitch
-----

In a hurry? Don't worry! **Will I make it** is your ultimate transit guide for Warsaw.

**Will I make it** has several killer features that distinguish it from your typical transit app. For example, it allows you to track your connection in real time, so that you can get a sense of how close or far your tram is. Moreover, it provides estimated travel times based on historical data for the current day and time of day.

About
-----

**Will I make it** is a Shiny app built by the Efficacy Analytics team from the Pearson Poznan office during the [Urban Sensors data science hackathon](http://whyr.pl/hackathon/) held on 26 Sep 2017 as part of the [Why R conference](http://whyr.pl).

Urban Sensors was a hackathon designed to make use of [VaVeL](http://www.vavel-project.eu) - an EU-funded project to help people take advatage of open data provided by such cities as Warsaw.

**Will I make it** is a Shiny app that utilises two datasets: static data about the Warsaw public transport system (e.g. timetables), and historical data on the actual movements of public transport throughout the day.

Note this app is a proof of concept put together during an 8-hr hackathon using previously-unknown datasets, so we currently support only selected tram lines. Everything else definitely works as advertised. ;)
